stat89a-binder-example
======================

This repo contains a copy of UC Berkeley's Stat 89a single user image environment from the [datahub repository](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/tree/staging/deployments/stat89a/image). It is meant to be a short term demonstration of how to run course materials outside of Berkeley infrastructure.
